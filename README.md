# To-do-List
A to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks effectively. The HTML structure provides the layout for displaying tasks and input fields, while CSS styles the app for a visually pleasing user interface. JavaScript handles the logic for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
